# 📘 Module 1: The World of Cybersecurity

## What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting **systems, networks, and data** from digital attacks, misuse, or damage.

### CIA Triad (Core Foundation)
- **Confidentiality** – Data is accessed only by authorized users  
- **Integrity** – Data is accurate and not altered without permission  
- **Availability** – Systems and data are available when needed  

Every security control supports one or more of these principles.

---

## Data and Digital Assets
- Data is more valuable than hardware  
- Digital assets include credentials, emails, databases, logs, and source code  
- Attackers target **data and access**, not devices  

---

## Online Identity
Your digital identity includes:
- Name, email, phone number  
- Login credentials  
- IP address and device information  
- Online behavior and social media activity  

Attackers often collect identity information **before attacking**.

---

## Smart Devices and IoT
- Always connected  
- Often poorly secured  
- Default passwords and rare updates  

Compromised smart devices can be used for spying or botnet attacks.

---

## Hacker Motivation
Hackers target:
- Money (fraud, ransomware)
- Data (selling or blackmail)
- Access (long-term control)
- Influence (political or social)

Most real attacks are **silent and hidden**.

---

# 🔥 Module 2: Attacks, Concepts, and Techniques

## What is a Cyber Attack?
Any action that compromises:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

Most attacks are slow and stealthy, not loud.

---

## Malware Types
- **Virus** – attaches to legitimate files  
- **Worm** – self-spreading  
- **Trojan** – appears legitimate but is malicious  
- **Ransomware** – encrypts data and demands payment  
- **Spyware** – secretly monitors user activity  

Malware usually enters through **user action**, not forced access.

---

## Social Engineering (Most Dangerous Attack)
Manipulating people instead of systems using:
- Urgency
- Fear
- Authority
- Curiosity

One successful phishing email can bypass all technical security.

---

## Password Attacks
Common methods:
- Guessing
- Brute force
- Dictionary attacks
- Credential stuffing (using leaked passwords)

Password reuse causes massive account compromise.

---

## On-Path / MITM Attacks
Attacker secretly intercepts communication between:
- User and website
- User and network

Common on public Wi-Fi and fake hotspots.

---

## DoS and DDoS Attacks
Goal: **Make services unavailable**
- DoS → single attacker
- DDoS → many infected systems (botnet)

Targets availability, not data.

---

## Botnets
A network of compromised devices controlled remotely.
Used for:
- DDoS attacks
- Spam
- Credential attacks

Many infected devices belong to normal users.

---

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits
- **Vulnerability** – weakness in system or software  
- **Exploit** – method to abuse that weakness  

Unpatched systems are easy targets.

---

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
- Highly targeted
- Long-term
- Stealthy
- Often nation-state level

Goal is continuous access, not quick damage.

---

# 🔐 Module 3: Protecting Your Data and Privacy

## Device Security
Key protections:
- Regular updates
- Antivirus / endpoint protection
- Firewalls
- Limited user privileges

Most attacks succeed due to outdated systems.

---

## Home Network Security
- Change router default credentials
- Use WPA2/WPA3 encryption
- Update firmware
- Disable WPS

A compromised router exposes all connected devices.

---

## Password Strategy
Best practices:
- Long passwords or passphrases
- Unique passwords per service
- Use a password manager
- Never reuse passwords

---

## Public Wi-Fi Risks
Public networks allow:
- Traffic interception
- Fake hotspots
- MITM attacks

Avoid sensitive logins on public Wi-Fi.

---

## Data Ownership
You create data, but companies often **control** it.
Free services monetize user data.

More data shared = more risk.

---

## Terms of Service and Privacy Policies
Important points:
- What data is collected
- How it is used
- Who it is shared with
- Whether you can delete it

Defaults usually favor companies.

---

## Privacy Settings
Control:
- Profile visibility
- Tracking
- Ads
- Location sharing

Public information is valuable to attackers.

---

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Authentication types:
- SMS (weakest)
- Authenticator apps (strong)
- Hardware keys (strongest)

2FA blocks most real-world attacks.

---

## OAuth (Login with Google/Facebook)
Apps receive **limited access tokens**, not passwords.

Regularly review and revoke unused app access.

---

## Spoofing
Fake but convincing:
- Emails
- Websites
- Calls
- Wi-Fi networks

Always verify before trusting.

---

# 🏢 Module 4: Cybersecurity Devices, Technologies, and Operations

## Firewalls
Control network traffic using:
- IP addresses
- Ports
- Protocols
- Direction rules

Reduce exposure, not eliminate risk.

---

## Port Scanning
Used by:
- Defenders to find weaknesses
- Attackers to find entry points

Open ports = open doors.

---

## IDS and IPS
- **IDS** – Detects suspicious activity
- **IPS** – Detects and blocks attacks

Detection methods:
- Signature-based
- Behavior-based

---

## Malware Protection
Modern systems use:
- Signatures
- Heuristics
- Behavior analysis

Behavior detection is critical against modern threats.

---

## Behavior-Based Security
Focuses on:
- Abnormal activity
- Unusual logins
- Unexpected data transfers

Many modern attacks use legitimate credentials.

---

## NetFlow and Traffic Analysis
Analyzes:
- Who communicates with whom
- Data volume
- Timing patterns

Helps detect hidden attacks.

---

## Penetration Testing
Authorized security testing to:
- Identify weaknesses
- Improve defenses

Permission defines legality.

---

## Risk Management
Security aims to:
- Reduce risk
- Reduce impact
- Improve recovery

100% security is impossible.

---

## Incident Response
Steps:
1. Detect
2. Analyze
3. Contain
4. Eradicate
5. Recover
6. Improve

Security is continuous.

---

# ⚖️ Module 5: Legal, Ethics, and Careers

## Legal Boundaries
Hacking without permission is illegal.
Permission, intent, and scope define legality.

Testing systems without approval is a crime.

---

## Ethical Responsibility
Ethical professionals:
- Protect users
- Respect privacy
- Avoid misuse
- Report responsibly

Trust is critical in cybersecurity.

---

## Privacy and Access
Security professionals handle sensitive data.
Abuse of access ends careers permanently.

---

## Cybersecurity Careers
Common roles:
- SOC Analyst
- Penetration Tester
- Network Security Engineer
- Cloud Security Specialist
- GRC Analyst

Foundations matter before specialization.

---

## Certifications and Growth
Certifications validate knowledge.
Labs and projects build skills.

Balance theory, practice, and ethics.

---
