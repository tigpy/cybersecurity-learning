# Linux File Permissions

Linux uses file permissions to control who can read, write, or execute a file.

## Permission Types
- Read (r): View file contents
- Write (w): Modify file contents
- Execute (x): Run the file as a program

## Permission Groups
- Owner
- Group
- Others

## Common Commands
- ls -l
- chmod
- chown

Understanding permissions is important in cybersecurity because misconfigured permissions can lead to privilege escalation.
